GET /blog/categories/
    Larger (16+ digits) id values are rounded visually when displayed on the site

POST /blog/categories/
    trims first character off of names when creating a new category
    doesn't use the first available id, just the highest (probably not actually a problem)
    500 error when passing in an id for a category that already exists
    accepts negative values for "id" (can't be deleted afterwards)
    "id": 0 seems to be default value, adding it manually just appends the category as normal rather than inserting at 0
        can't actually have an "id" of 0
            apparently yes you can, it just requires 0 to be higher than all existing ids
    500 error when using "id" value above 9223372036854775807 (or below -9223372036854775808)
    "id" values of 9223372036854775807 are input as 9223372036854776000
        rounded to 16 digits
        allows duplicate values for "id"
        visual only - cannot use 9223372036854776000 to delete these categories
        same for negative values (-9223372036854775808 to -9223372036854776000)
        If I had to guess I'd say that the value in the SQL table is correct, but just gets rounded when python returns the dict
        Nevermind, looks like it's a issue with the browser, the actual JSON is correct
    would be useful if the endpoint returned the id of the submitted category
    no apparent limit on "name" character count
    400 response not accounted for in api documentation
    Chooses a random id if at the int max?

DELETE /blog/categories/{id}
    Allows for deletion of categories that have posts
    Same as above, 500 error when submitting values above 9223372036854775807
